#TRAVELAGENT APPLICATION

This is the application used for a class on Ruby on Rails based around a travel agency that books cruises for its customers. You can find the practicals explaining the steps to build this app at: https://homepages.abdn.ac.uk/b.scharlau/pages/rails-pages/ 

The goal of this practical is to move beyond simple apps to one, which brings a variety of aspects referenced tables and objects together so that the participants experience the breadth and variety available in Rails applications.

Version 1 was created quickly and without much consideration to the order of what should be done. This worked as a proof of concept.

Version 2 was created with more thought about the order in which concepts in Rails were introduced, and how the application was developed. We'll see how this works this year with students.gh

By the way, some of you might recognise this app as being based on the travel agent example from the O'Reilly Enterprise JavaBeans book. This is, indeed, a take on that old scenario.
